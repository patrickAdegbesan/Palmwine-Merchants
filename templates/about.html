          <h2>Palmwine Heritage & Culture</h2>
          <p>Palmwine is more than a beverage—it is a cultural touchstone across West Africa. From the skilled tappers who climb tall palms to collect fresh sap, to the sellers—called <em>elemu</em> in Yoruba—who serve it in decorated gourds, palmwine connects people, craft, and community.</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li><strong>Traditional craft:</strong> Tappers make precise incisions and attach gourds to collect sap from the tree.</li>
            <li><strong>Living fermentation:</strong> Reused gourds carry native yeasts/bacteria that jump‑start fermentation for the next batch.</li>
            <li><strong>Everyday refreshment:</strong> Workers often enjoy palmwine during breaks—cooling relief in tropical heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Art & memory:</strong> Palmwine tapping and sharing are frequently depicted in modern African art, reflecting its social importance.</li>
          </ul>
